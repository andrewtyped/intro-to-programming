Intro to Programming Lab
========================

Welcome to the programming lab! We'll be building a small web site which draws lines and shapes based on a user's input.

Objectives
----------

- Introduce JavaScript programming concepts, including:
    - Variables / Constants
    - Loops
    - Arrays
    - Objects
    - The document object model (DOM)

- Transform a user's input into structured data (A process called *parsing*). For this lab, we'll be parsing text into coordinates.

- Use world-space coordinates to draw lines on the screen.

Setup
-----

Development on a Chromebook requires advanced setup, and I don't want to break anyone's computer. Instead, we'll be using a web-based *integrated development environment* (IDE) to edit code files. You will need an account:

- Open Chrome and visit https://codeanywhere.com/
- Click the 'Sign Up' button
- Provide an email address and password for your account. Follow through the reCAPTCHA prompt if necessary
- Click register.
- Open your email. You should get a message from support@codeanywhere.com asking you to confirm your account. Click the link in the e-mail to complete the registration process.

Congratulations! We're ready to get the project files.

- Login to CodeAnywhere and visit https://codeanywhere.com/editor/
- A 'Connection Wizard' dialog should appear
- In the list on the left of the wizard, click 'Git from URL'.
- Paste the following link into the textbox that appears: https://github.com/andrewtyped/intro-to-programming.git
- Click 'NEXT'
- Type a name for the project. 'programming lab', maybe.
- Next, we need to select the 'Stack' for the project. I'll explain this later. Scroll or search the list for 'HTML', and select the row that says 'Ubuntu' on the right. 
- click 'CREATE'

A 'Create Container' dialog should appear. Sit tight.

- After 2-3 minutes, the dialog should close and a file structure should appear on the left.
- Expand the lab/src/check_setup folder.
- Right-click on check_setup.html and click 'Preview'
- A web page should open with the text 'It Works!' and an image.

We're ready to code. Await further instructions.
