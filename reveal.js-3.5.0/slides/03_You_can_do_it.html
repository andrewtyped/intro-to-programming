            When I was young, there was a certain stigma around programming. I heard messages like:
            <ul>
                <li>It's very hard.</li>
                <li>It's tedious.</li>
                <li>You need a special kind of brain.</li>
                <li>There's a lot of competition for jobs.</li>
            </ul>

            Messages like this may have kept me from investigating programming as a career earlier. They're half-truths.
            <ul>
                <li>It's very hard (Sometimes. Often it's fun despite being hard.)</li>
                <li>You need a special kind of brain. (It helps to be logic-, science-, or design-minded. These are teachable)</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
