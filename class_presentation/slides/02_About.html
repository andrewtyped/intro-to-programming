        My name is Andrew Barger. I graduated from speed school in 2012 w/ a degree in Industrial Engineering, which studies process improvement in industrial settings. Think quality control, facility layout, manufacturing best practices, etc. I enjoyed the software
        packages we used for statistics, simulation, and optimization, but never gave much thought to creating software modeling, until I took an interdisciplinary course which heavily relied on programming. It left such an impression on me that I incorporated
        more and more coding into my other coursework, at which point I realized I'd rather work on software than anything related directly to my major. I had friends in the field and was fortunate to secure an entry-level job, mostly working simple support
        tickets and small bug fixes. For the most part, I've taught myself the skills needed to advance in the field. I currently work for Bastian Solutions, working on web and desktop applications for warehouse automation.
